## Documentation and its Importance in Software Development

Documentation is a crucial tool that serves as a guide for developers who are new to a project, providing them with the information they need to get started. It fosters collaboration and teamwork by enabling effective communication between testers, users, designers, and developers. With its help, all stakeholders can work together more efficiently towards a common goal.

Comprehensive documentation can help during troubleshooting and help developers implement the right solution. Documentation can serve as a tool for seamless onboarding and help developers build upon existing work.
