## Theming your Documentation

** If you are using MKDocs to create documentation, you have the option to customize its appearance by using a theme. There are two ways to do this:

1. It's important to note that you must choose one of the two available themes, which are 'MKDocs' and 'readthedocs'.

@. Alternatively, you can use a third-party theme of your choice.

To change the theme, simply make changes to the theme setting in your file.

When using a third-party theme, specify its name as it is not provided by the platform.

  theme:
    name: my_custom_theme

Third-party themes can be used to install themes on your device.

  pip install mkdocs-my_custom_theme

You can specify the name of the theme in your file.
