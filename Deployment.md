# Deploying your Documentation

 To complete the process, we will be hosting our documentation on GitHub Pages. MKDocs offers a command to build the documentation, which will generate a folder named "site". You have the option to upload your folder to GitHub by either using the command line or pushing it directly.

Follow these steps to build and deploy your documentation via MKDocs.

* After completing the writing and editing of your documentation, build your site using the command below.

`mkdocs build`

This command will create a directory named [site] source that contains the source code for your documentation's static site.

* You can choose to host your documentation on any web hosting platform, such as Vercel or Netlify. This allows others to easily access your work by clicking on the link to the hosted pages.
